## Hi there! üëãüèª

I‚Äôm a **Graduate Research Assistant** and **Master of Science student** in **Bioinformatics** at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). I am passionate about combining the fields of bioinformatics, machine learning, and medical imaging to explore innovative solutions in healthcare and life sciences.

Currently, I am engaged in research at two exciting laboratories:

- **[Biomedical Signal and Image Processing Laboratory (BiSIPL)](https://ee.sharif.edu/~fatemizadeh/)**  
  *Electrical Engineering Department*  
  Under the supervision of Professor [Emad Fatemizadeh](https://ee.sharif.edu/~fatemizadeh/), I am working on cutting-edge projects in biomedical signal and image processing.

- **[Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Laboratory (RIML)](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/)**  
  *Computer Engineering Department*  
  Supervised by Professor [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/), my research focuses on developing robust and interpretable machine learning models.
