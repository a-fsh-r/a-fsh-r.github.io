I am a first-year MSc student of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University. I'm working under the supervision of professor [Brett Meyer](http://rssl.ece.mcgill.ca/people/#bretthmeyer) at McGill Edge Intelligence Lab (MEIL). Previously I received my BSc in Computer Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology.
